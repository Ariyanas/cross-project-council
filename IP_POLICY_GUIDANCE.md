# OpenJS Foundation IP Policy Guidance

The purpose of this guide is to make it straightforward for projects
to follow the [OpenJS Foundation IP Policy][IP Policy].

Of course, the source of truth remains the [IP Policy][].

If in doubt about anything related to IP after reading this document,
first read the [IP Policy][], and then [ask for help](#getting-help).

## Basic requirements

There are four key requirements for all OpenJS Foundation projects:

1. [Licensing](#1-licensing)
2. [Copyright notices](#2-copyright-notices)
3. Displaying the [standard website footer](#3-standard-website-footer) on the project's website
4. Choose between the [DCO][] or a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](#4-contributor-license-agreement-cla)

### 1. Licensing

Code may be licensed under:
  * [Apache, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
  * [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
  * [2-Clause BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)
  * [3-Clause BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)

Documentation may be licensed under:
  * [CC BY 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
  * [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

If you need to use a license which isn't in the [IP Policy],
you will need to obtain permission from the Board to do so.

### 2. Copyright notices

The recommendation is to use a general copyright statement
of the following form (where XYZ is the project's name):

- **Copyright The XYZ Authors.**
- **Copyright The XYZ Contributors.**
- **Copyright Contributors to the XYZ project.**

By using this format, the project avoids having to deal with
names of copyright holders, years or ranges of years,
and variations on the (c) symbol.

_Please note that you **must not** change or remove existing copyright lines
unless you put them there **and** have the right to do so.
If there are existing copyright lines just
add the recommended copyright statement below the existing copyright lines.
You may however update copyright lines that say
"JS Foundation" or "Node.js Foundation" to "OpenJS Foundation"
as this simply reflects the merged status of the organizations._

### 3. Standard website footer

All project websites need to have a [standard website footer][].

### 4. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

By default the OpenJS Foundation uses the [DCO][], which means contributors
submit their contributions under the project's designated open source license.
Every commit must contain a Signed-off-by line in the commit message (e.g.,
`Signed-off-by: Authorname <author@email.com>`), indicating the author has the
right to make the contribution under the open source license.

Alternately, projects may decide to adopt a CLA. In this case each contributor
must be covered by a signed CLA, either as an individual contributor on their
own behalf or from their employer. The OpenJS Foundation Board of Directors has
pre-approved an [Individual CLA][ICLA] and a [Corporate CLA][CCLA] which
projects can adopt without any further review. The decision to adopt a CLA is
left to each project's governing body.

When a contributor signs the default OpenJS Foundation CLA in one project, they
will automatically be covered for any other project which uses the same CLA.

To use the CLA with your project, or if there are special circumstances that
may require a different CLA, please contact
[legal-questions@lists.openjsf.org](mailto:legal-questions@lists.openjsf.org).
